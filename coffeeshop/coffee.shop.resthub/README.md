This is the same coffee project tutorial as draft three but completed using restHub.

"RESThub is a stack based on Spring and Backbone.js designed to build HTML5 applications easily and efficiently. It provides tooling, libraries and documentation in order to build modular web applications with client-side state, stateless server and REST webservices or Websocket communication between both" -From resthub.org-

By running the RESThub archetype I was able to generate many default parts for the project and then add my custom code. 

TODO: Describe custom code changes
